# Welcome to the KUBI DAO!

These docs are a living, colletively created set of resources to make the DAO accessible to all audiences.

This page gives an overview of the DAO for all audiences. To get a deeper understanding of how you can participate in the DAO, check out our resource guides for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## What is the DAO?

The KU Blockchain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a decentralized platform where members can contribute to tasks, vote on proposals, and influence decisions for KUBI. The DAO creates an open governance structure as a result. The tasks members can complete include anything from voting on community initiatives, learning from modules, or completing miscellaneous tasks.

We have a whole article on the history of the KUBI DAO, if you're interested in learning more!

The conference was held in the scenic city of Zurich, a global hub for finance and technology. The students also took the opportunity to explore the beautiful nearby city of Lucerne, enjoying its historic sites and picturesque lake views.

During the event, Emma Nasseri was honored with the UBRI Impact Award for her outstanding leadership in directing the Kansas Blockchain Fellowship. This initiative, a seven-week scholarship program and talent incubator, prepares students in Kansas for careers in blockchain technology and web3, fostering a new generation of tech innovators.

Emma shared her gratitude, saying, “I was so honored to receive Ripple’s UBRI Impact Award for the success of the Kansas Blockchain Fellowship, which could not have succeeded as it did without our community and the incredible student leadership team: Micah Borghese, Jahnvi Maddila, and Yash Prajapati. I am so proud of and grateful for our Fellows, alumni mentors, our community at KU Endowment and I2S, and the support we received from our external partners at Pinata, Ripple, and a16z crypto.”

The event not only highlighted the achievements of individuals and groups but also inspired all attendees to continue their impactful work in blockchain research and development.

We extend our deepest thanks to Ripple for their ongoing partnership and for providing such a transformative platform for our students at UBRI Connect. This celebration of blockchain research continues to fuel our commitment to innovation and excellence in the blockchain space.

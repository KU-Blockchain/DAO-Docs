# Welcome to the KUBI Docs!

These docs are a living, colletively created set of resources to make KUBI's internal tools, especially the DAO, accessible to all audiences.

This page gives an overview of the DAO for all audiences. To get a deeper understanding of how you can participate in the DAO, check out our resource guides for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## What is the DAO?

The KU Blockchain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a decentralized platform where members can earn rewards for contributing to community tasks, vote on proposals to influence community decisions. The DAO creates an open governance structure as a result, meaning anyone can earn rewards for their contributions and move up the leaderboard. The tasks members can complete include anything from voting on community initiatives, learning from modules, or completing miscellaneous tasks.

While you don't need to deeply understand these things to get started, we've also created tons of resources on things like the **[history of the KUBI DAO](blog/2024-12-05-history-of-the-KUBI-DAO.md)** so that you can understand not just how to use the DAO, but the intentions behind its creation and its benefits to our community.

## Why do we use the DAO?

1. **Enabling Democracy**: The DAO is a tool for ensuring every KUBI member has an equal opportunity to be recognized for their contributions.
2. **Empowering Developers**: Giving members structured opportunities for hands-on learning and experimentation in web3 through open source contribution.
3. **Incentivizing Learning and Engagement**: Rewarding the effort and impact that simple contributions like learning and attending meetings have on our community.

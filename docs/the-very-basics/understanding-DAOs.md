# Definition of a DAO

![DAO Definition](./img/dao_definition.png "DAO Definition")

The term "DAO" can mean a lot of things. It stands for **"Decentralized Autonomous Organization."**

Let's start by breaking down the literal definition.

- **Decentralized**: Not controlled by a single entity or central authority. In the context of a DAO, this means that control is spread across all members who have a stake or a role, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.
- **Autonomous**: Able to operate independently without the need for human intervention. A DAO operates according to rules encoded as computer programs called [smart contracts](understanding-smart-contracts), which automatically execute decisions based on the inputs from its members.
- **Organization**: A group of individuals who come together for a common purpose. In a DAO, this group collaboratively makes decisions and manages resources collectively, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency and fairness.

# DAOs in Practice

DAO is often interpreted to mean any organization with smart contract based governance. DAOs are commonly seen as efficient ways for a distributed group of people to organize online to make governance decisions or manage a pool of shared funds.

# Voting Guide for the KU Blockchain Club DAO

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on voting within the KU Blockchain Club DAO! Voting is a crucial aspect of our community, allowing all members to actively participate in shaping the direction and decisions of our club. Whether you're new to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or unfamiliar with voting mechanisms, this guide will help you understand how to engage with our DAO's democratic processes.

## Understanding Voting Types

Our DAO employs two main types of voting mechanisms: **Hybrid Voting** and **Direct Democracy Voting**. Here's what you need to know about each:

### Hybrid Voting

Hybrid Voting is a unique system that combines elements of direct democracy and participation-based voting. This means your influence in a vote can come both from your direct choice and your level of activity within the DAO.

- **How It Works**: In Hybrid Voting, the weight of the vote is split between direct votes from participants and weighted votes based on their contributions. For example, participant votes might count for 70% of the decision, while the community's overall participation weight counts for the remaining 30%.
- **Purpose**: This method encourages active participation and ensures that both heavily involved members and the wider community have significant input in key decisions.
- **Minimum Quorum**: At least 20% of total possible votes must be cast for a decision to be valid.

### Direct Democracy Voting

Direct Democracy Voting allows every member to vote directly on each issue, reflecting the true spirit of equality and member-driven governance.

- **How It Works**: Each member has one vote per issue, regardless of their role or contribution level.
- **Purpose**: This straightforward approach ensures that every member has a direct and equal say in our DAO's decisions.
- **Minimum Quorum**: Similar to Hybrid Voting, at least 20% of total possible votes must be cast for the decision to pass.

## Member Roles and Voting Rights

In our DAO, members are categorized into different types depending on their involvement and responsibilities:

- **Default Members**: All club members start here. Default members can vote in all elections and on all issues presented to the DAO.
- **Executive Members**: Members with executive status have additional privileges, including the ability to add tasks and create voting initiatives.

## Voting on Treasury and DAO Upgrades

Decisions regarding our treasury and any upgrades to the DAO system are made using the Hybrid Voting system. This ensures that both active participants and the broader community have a balanced say in these crucial aspects.

## How to Vote

1. **Log In**: Access our DAO platform and log into your account.
2. **Navigate to Voting Section**: Find the 'Voting' tab on the main dashboard.
3. **Review Open Votes**: Browse through current voting issues or tasks.
4. **Cast Your Vote**: Select your choice for each vote. Depending on the voting type, your vote may be weighted by your participation level.
5. **Submit Your Vote**: Confirm and submit your vote. You'll be notified of the voting results once they're finalized.

## Conclusion

Your vote matters! By participating in the voting process, you help steer the direction of the KU Blockchain Club DAO. Each vote contributes to a transparent, democratic, and equitable environment where all members have a say in our future.

Remember, active participation not only influences current decisions but also enhances your impact in future votes through the Hybrid Voting system. Get involved, stay engaged, and let's build a strong, community-driven club together!

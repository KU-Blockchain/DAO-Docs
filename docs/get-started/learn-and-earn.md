# Earn Tokens by Learning

One of the best ways to begin earning KUBIX through the DAO is through the ['Learn & Earn'](https://dao.kublockchain.com/edu-Hub/) page of the DAO. Here, you can find learning modules with bounties for completion.

Click the 'Learn' button on any module to find the learning resource. After going through the learning resource, you can click 'Take Quiz' to open up the mini-quiz. Once you get the answer right, you'll be automatically paid out the bounty for that learning section.

> **Important Note:** Don't take shortcuts on these quizzes! We know that it would be easy to just look up the answers, but the purpose of this feature of the DAO is to make learning more rewarding.

**Happy learning!**

# Overview

If you want to help maintain the KUBI DAO or DAO Docs, this section serves as a guide for making getting started with development as easy as possible.

## 2 Ways to Get Started Contributing

### **1. Join the DAO and Claim Tasks** (No coding required)

- Once you're set up in the DAO, you can find open issues on the [DAO Docs](https://dao.kublockchain.com/tasks/?projectId=DAO%20Docs-0xf4efc952759fa6b4bc5aafe8150f373feb9df208) project. There are sometimes also easy docs bounties on the [Getting Started](https://dao.kublockchain.com/tasks/?projectId=Getting%20Started-0xf4efc952759fa6b4bc5aafe8150f373feb9df208) project.
- Claim the task or move it into the In Progress column. Remember that every action is an on-chain transaction, so you'll have to sign a transaction for claiming it.
- Follow the instructions in the task to write the article, section, or page requested. Write the content yourself, but you can use AI to convert it into markdown, if you'd prefer.
- Submit a link to the markdown file in the DAO task submission field.
- Once an exec verifies the submission as valid, you will receive the bounty.

### 2. Contribute Directly to the KUBI Repo

- Email ku.blockchain.institute@gmail.com to request access to be added to the KUBI Github Organization.
  -- Alternatively, you can fork the repo into your own Github account. [Here is an article](https://daily.dev/blog/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-github-repositories#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20is%20to,to%20your%20own%20GitHub%20account.) on how to contribute this way.
- Once you're a part of the KUBI Organization, you can clone the repo, make a new branch, and start developing directly. The instructions for this are below.

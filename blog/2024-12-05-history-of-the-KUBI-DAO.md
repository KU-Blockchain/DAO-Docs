As our KUBI community continues to grow, we realize how important it is to document the history and journey of this growth and preserve everything we've learned for the leaders that come after us.

Prior to the DAO, KUBI had experimented with decentralized task management and governance with tools like DeWork and Aragon. However, nothing had the customizability or full range of features needed to meet all of the team’s needs.

Hudson had the vision for a custom DAO for a long time, but in the Spring of 2024, he began bringing it to life. In just a couple of months, he created the prototype for the first KUBI DAO 1.0 completely from scratch, on the Polygon Mumbai testnet using React, IPFS, Solidity, Chakra UI, and The Graph.

This DAO 1.0 was officially launched in Fall 2022 and used by KUBI through Spring 2023.

At ETHDenver 2024, Hudson built the first iteration of the Perpetual Organization Architect (Poa), a no-code AI DAO-builder enabling anyone to create and deploy their own Perpetual Organization.

Perpetual Organization is a phrase Hudson coined, which ultimately better describes member-owned, on-chain organizations relevant to all kinds of communities, not just those in web3. While both DAO and Perpetual Organization accurately describe what current KUBI platform is, members typically refer to it as “The DAO” out of habit.

In Fall 2024, KUBI officially launched The DAO 2.0, making it the first ever organization deployed with Poa. Since then, word of the KUBI DAO has spread across blockchain student organizations all over, with communities everywhere beginning the governance design process to prepare to deploying with Poa.

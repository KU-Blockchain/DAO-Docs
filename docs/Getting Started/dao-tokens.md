# Understanding Tokens in Our DAO

Welcome to our guide on understanding the digital tokens used in our DAO! This document will explain what these tokens are, how they work, and why they are important. We will focus on three main types of tokens: KUBIX tokens, Executive NFTs, and Membership tokens.

## What are Tokens?

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a token represents a unit of value issued by an organization or project. It can have various uses such as granting access to services, representing voting power, or even as a reward system. Tokens are digital and can be transferred between individuals or entities on a blockchain network.

## KUBIX Tokens

### Overview

- **Name**: KUBIX
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on Polygon Amoy
- **Real Money Value**: None

KUBIX tokens are the primary currency within our DAO. They are used to reward members for their participation and to facilitate certain transactions within the DAO, such as voting and rewards for completed tasks.

### Key Points

- **No Real Money Value**: KUBIX tokens are not real money and do not have monetary value. They are meant to be used within our DAO to engage in activities and gain benefits.
- **Usage**: These tokens can be earned by participating in DAO activities and spent within the DAO ecosystem on various privileges and opportunities.

## Executive NFTs

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital tokens that represent ownership of a specific item or privilege. In our DAO, Executive NFTs are special tokens that grant the holder executive privileges.

### Privileges Include:

- Ability to add or modify tasks
- Create votes and make executive decisions
- Special access within the DAO platform

## Membership Tokens

Membership tokens are issued to each member who joins our DAO. These tokens are essential for participating in our DAO's direct democracy voting system.

### Details

- **Total Issued**: 100 tokens per member
- **Purpose**: Used for voting in the direct democracy system.

## What is Quadratic Voting?

Quadratic voting is a voting system that allows participants to express how strongly they feel about an issue rather than just whether they are for or against it.

### How It Works:

- **Voting Power**: Each membership token represents a basic unit of voting power.
- **Casting Multiple Votes**: Members can cast multiple votes on a single proposal. The cost of each additional vote grows exponentially, which means the second vote costs 2 tokens, the third vote costs 4 tokens, and so on.
- **Purpose**: This system helps prevent a minority of members with many tokens from easily dominating the vote, promoting a more equitable and democratic decision-making process.

## Conclusion

Tokens in our DAO, whether they are KUBIX tokens, Executive NFTs, or Membership tokens, play a crucial role in how our community operates. They are tools that enable participation, reward contributions, and ensure that every member has a voice in the governance of the DAO.

Remember, while these tokens are valuable within our community, they do not have real-world monetary value and should be viewed as tools for engagement and participation in our DAO.

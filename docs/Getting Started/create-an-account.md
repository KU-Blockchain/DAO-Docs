# Getting Started with MetaMask and Polygon

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on setting up your MetaMask wallet, loading it with Matic tokens from the Polygon Faucet, and creating your DAO username with your KU.edu email. This guide is tailored for beginners, so no prior knowledge of blockchain or web3 is necessary.

## Step 1: Downloading and Installing MetaMask

MetaMask is a digital wallet that allows you to manage your Ethereum and other blockchain assets. It also lets you interact with decentralized applications (dApps).

### Instructions:

1. **Go to the MetaMask Website**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/).
2. **Download the Extension**:
   - Click on the "Download" button. Choose the version that corresponds to your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).
3. **Install MetaMask**:

   - Follow the instructions to add the MetaMask extension to your browser.

4. **Create Your Wallet**:
   - Open MetaMask by clicking on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
   - Click on "Create a Wallet" and agree to the terms.
   - Create a strong password and write down your secret recovery phrase. Keep this phrase safe and private; it's the key to your wallet!

## Step 2: Acquiring Matic Tokens from the Polygon Faucet

Polygon uses Matic tokens for transaction fees. To interact with our DAO, you'll need some Matic in your wallet.

### Instructions:

1. **Copy Your Wallet Address**:

   - Open MetaMask.
   - Click on the account name at the top of the wallet to copy your wallet address.

2. **Visit the Polygon Faucet**:

   - Go to the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
   - Select the "Mumbai" network, as it's the test network for Polygon.

3. **Receive Matic Tokens**:
   - Paste your wallet address into the faucet's address field.
   - Complete any required captcha or verification tasks.
   - Click "Submit" to receive your free Matic tokens.
   - It may take a few minutes for the tokens to appear in your wallet.

## Step 3: Creating Your Username with Your KU.edu Email

To participate in our DAO, you need to create a username associated with your KU.edu email. This will help us verify your identity as a student or faculty member.

### Instructions:

1. **Access the DAO Platform**:

   - Navigate to our DAO's website.

2. **Sign Up for an Account**:

   - Look for the sign-up or registration option on the home page.
   - Enter your details, including your KU.edu email, to register.

3. **Verify Your Email**:

   - Check your KU.edu email for a verification link.
   - Click on the link to confirm your email address and complete the registration process.

4. **Set Up Your Username**:
   - Follow the prompts to choose a username for your DAO account.
   - Ensure your username is unique and represents your identity within the DAO.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a MetaMask wallet loaded with Matic and a username linked to your KU.edu email. You're all set to explore and participate in our DAO. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

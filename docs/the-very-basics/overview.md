# Overview

This section is not an essential prerequisite for using the DAO, but it might give you helpful background if you're new to web3. Here, you can find definition demystifying buzzwords like [blockchain](understanding-blockchain.md), [DAOs](understanding-DAOs.md), [smart contracts](understanding-smart-contracts.md), and [tokens](understanding-tokens.md).

If you want to dive deeper into these topics, you can go through [KU Blockchain's Foundations of Blockchain Learning Curriculum](https://kublockchain.notion.site/Foundations-of-Blockchain-7ff28f61d6c347feb624866d32f0242b).

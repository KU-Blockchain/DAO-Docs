# Welcome to the KU Blockchain Institute DAO

## Overview

The KU Blockchain Institute DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization designed to empower club members by facilitating democratic participation in decision-making processes and task management. Built entirely from scratch in 2023-2024, this platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

You can read about the [history of the DAO here](https://docs.kublockchain.com/blog/history-of-the-KUBI-DAO).

## Primary Purposes of the DAO

There are a lot of advantages to the KUBI DAO, but

1. **Enabling Democracy**: The DAO is a tool for ensuring every KUBI member has an equal opportunity to be recognized for their contributions.
2. **Empowering Developers**: Giving members structured opportunities for hands-on learning and experimentation in web3 through open source contribution.
3. **Incentivizing Learning and Engagement**: Rewarding the effort and impact that simple contributions like learning and attending meetings have on our community.

## Key Features

### **Dashboard**

### **Task Manager**

Members can view and take on various tasks needed by the club. Each task includes a title, a detailed description, and an associated bounty in KUBIX tokens, which are calculated based on the task's estimated difficulty and time required.

### **Voting Platform**

There are two types of votes within the DAO:

- **Direct Democracy**: Every member has a vote on decisions impacting the club like elections for the executive team, ensuring each voice is heard.
- **Participation-Based Voting**: Votes are weighted based on members' participation and contributions, promoting active involvement.

### **Education Hub**

Also known as the Learn and Earn page, this part of the DAO has a series of bounties for members just getting started, so that even if they don't know anything about blockchain, they can be rewarded for the effort it takes to the basics.

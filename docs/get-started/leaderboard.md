## Why the Leaderboard Matters

The Leaderboard serves as a way to recognize and involve members more deeply within the club. It isn't just about rankings but more about recognizing your dedication and contributions to the club. We use KUBIX tokens, the DAO's participation tokens, which are earned through activities like completing tasks and engaging with educational modules. These tokens directly reflect a member's involvement and impact within the DAO and quantify your involvement in a meaningful way. 

Featuring these accomplishments on your resume can offer a solid, quantifiable way to showcase your commitment and achievements to potential employers or academic programs, where explaining your club involvement might otherwise be challenging. This makes your contributions both visible and valuable, far beyond our club's activities. Also, the higher up you are on the leaderboard, the more likely you will be eligible for our [trips](https://docs.kublockchain.com/blog)!!


## How It Works

Members earn KUBIX by engaging in various activities such as researching blockchain topics, contributing to projects, or completing educational modules on the [Learn and Earn](https://dao.kublockchain.com/edu-Hub/) page. Accumulating KUBIX helps members move up the Leaderboard, showcasing their active participation and understanding.

## Motivation to Climb the Leaderboard

Advancing on the Leaderboard not only enhances your eligibility for exciting trips but also unlocks access to exclusive KUBI merchandise! As you cross each tier, new merch becomes available, items exlusive to the exec team or ones that other members don't have. These rewards symbolize your growing role and achievements within the club, marking each new level of your involvement with special perks.


Check the Leaderboard anytime to see where you stand, and visit the [Taskboard](https://dao.kublockchain.com/tasks/) or [Learn and Earn](https://dao.kublockchain.com/edu-Hub/) pages for opportunities to move up and increase your impact within the club.
